# Middle School Mayhem

## About the game
The game is made in one week as a submission to [Brackeys Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-6/rate/1177745).

**Middle School Mayhem** is an action game about a student who plans to free all the students from their boring and oppressive school. The student group gets bigger and powerful as more students join in. The ultimate goal is to storm into the principalâ€™s office and cause chaos in the school.

In the voting period, our game was determined to be top 25% of all games submitted which marks another year with a successful game jam.
